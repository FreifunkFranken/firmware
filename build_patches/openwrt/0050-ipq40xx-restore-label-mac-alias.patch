Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ipq40xx: re-add label MAC address for FritzBox 4040

The MAC address of the GMAC is contained inside the CWMP-Account
number on the label.

The label MAC address alias was defined previously, but it has been
removed with the switch to IPQESS / DSA.

Restore the label MAC address alias.
