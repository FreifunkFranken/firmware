## This file is used to configure the behavior of network interfaces
## if the routers interfaces differ from the standard WAN+4LAN-Ports
## +2Wireless APs.
## If you want to change their behavior, you should edit the file
## /etc/network.config
## After that you have to reboot the router with following command.
#reboot
#
### The canonical syntax of this file is:
#SPECIFIER="MODE"
### MODES
## Generally there are 3 operating modes for network interfaces in fff.
#BATMAN: The interface is used to mesh with other fff-nodes
#WAN:    The interface is used to connect to supernodes via vpn and
#         ordinary internet.
#CLIENT: The interface is used to connect clients to the fff-net
##
### SPECIFIER
## For devices only including one ethernet port the specifier is called
## ETHMODE. The default mode for these devices is "BATMAN".
## For example this is the case for: gl-ar150, tl-mr3020-v1, tl-wa850re-v1,
## tl-wa860re-v1, tl-wa901nd-v2, ubnt-bullet-m, ubnt-loco-m-xw, ubnt-nano-m,
## ubnt-unifi
ETHMODE="BATMAN"
## Devices featuring 2 ethernet ports are configured by SPECIFIERs ressembling
## the labels on the PORT itself. For the cpe210 these are called LAN0 and LAN1.
## Therefore they are configured as follows:
LAN0MODE="WAN"
LAN1MODE="BATMAN"
